# Darts Handler

This is the implementation of the Darts handler for MindsDB.

## Darts
Darts is a Python library for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series data. It provides various time series forecasting models and utilities for working with time-based data.

## Implementation
This handler uses the Darts library to perform time series forecasting within MindsDB. It's designed to train time series forecasting models and make predictions based on the provided data.

## Requirements
Darts: Make sure you have Darts properly installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip install darts.

## Usage
### Setting up the Connection
Install MindsDB: If you haven't already, install MindsDB locally or in your preferred environment.

Create a Python File: Create a Python file containing the Darts handler implementation. You can use the provided code as a starting point.

Configure the Handler: In the Darts handler code, ensure that the handler is correctly configured with the necessary parameters, such as data preprocessing and model selection.

### Training the Model
To train a time series forecasting model, follow these steps:

Prepare Data: Ensure that your data is in the format [timestamp, value] or adjust the code to match your data structure.

Initialize the Handler: Initialize the Darts handler and provide the necessary configuration.

Train the Model: Use the train method to train the model with your time series data. The handler includes basic data preprocessing, such as scaling.

~~~
handler = DartsHandler(name="darts_handler", connection_data={})
handler.train(your_time_series_data)
~~~

### Making Forecasts
To make forecasts using the trained model, use the forecast method and specify the number of forecasted points:

~~~
forecasted_values = handler.forecast(num_forecast_points)
~~~

### Evaluation (Optional)
If you need to evaluate the model's performance, you can implement evaluation logic in the evaluate method within the handler.

### MindsDB Integration
In MindsDB, create a connection to the Darts handler using the following syntax:

~~~
CREATE DATABASE darts_datasource
WITH
engine='darts',
parameters={
    "connection_data": {}
};
~~~

Now, you can use this established connection to train models and make time series forecasts within MindsDB.

## Additional Considerations
Ensure that all required libraries and dependencies, including Darts, are properly installed in your Python environment.

Implement robust error handling and testing to ensure the stability of your integration.

Customize the handler code to match your specific use case, data structure, and model requirements.

Follow MindsDB's documentation and guidelines for integrating custom handlers.

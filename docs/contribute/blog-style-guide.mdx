title: Style Guide for MindsDB Technical Blogs
sidebarTitle: Technical Blogs Style Guide
---

As our blog grows and we get more writers to contribute, we need to build documents and processes to help us maintain high quality and consistent style. To serve this goal, we created a style guide to help writers, contributors and editors stay on the same page.
  
While most of our writers are software engineers first and authors second, we still expect them to follow consistent standards for each of our clients.

Below is our style guide, which is broken up into four sections:

    1. Voice
    2. Content
    3. Conventions
    4. Communication

## Voice

**Write in Second Person**

Speak to your readers directly using “you” and “your”. Avoid “we” and “our”.

Good:
```
You can use a web browser (like Chrome, Safari, or Edge) to access web sites on the internet.
```

Bad:
```
We can use our web browsers (like Chrome, Safari, or Edge) to access web sites on the internet.
```

**Use Conversational, Business-Appropriate Language**

Read your article out loud and ask yourself, “Would I talk like this at work?” Use your real-world experience, but avoid jargon when possible.

Good:
```
Experts agree that the internet was not the product of any individual mind, but a series of advances in networking and computer science.
```

Bad:
```
Many scholars would agree that, had it not been for active networks, the simulation of Lamport clocks might never have occurred. The notion that end-users synchronize with the investigation of Markov models is rarely outdated. A theoretical grand challenge in theory is the important unification of virtual machines and real-time theory. To what extent can web browsers be constructed to achieve this purpose?
```

**Don’t Repeat Yourself**

Eliminate wordiness. You shouldn’t repeat yourself when programming, and you shouldn’t repeat yourself when writing.

Good:
```
A lively debate rages among software developers. The contentious issue is: tabs or spaces?
```

Bad:
```
There is currently a lively, ongoing controversy among many computer scientists and other professional in the field of software development: theories are being spun and arguments are being conducted among them about whether the use of tabs to designate indentation in a document is superior to the use of spaces for the same purpose.
```

## Content

The Introduction
Every article should have a 1-3 paragraph introduction. A good intro needs to answer a few questions right away:
What’s the paint point I’m addressing here? How do I hook my readers? 
What’s the solution to this problem?
What am I going to do in this article?
Make sure your introduction is completed by letting the user know how you’re going to teach them to solve this pain point.

Support Claims With Evidence
For every claim you make, ask yourself, “How can I prove this?” You can do this by:
Including a link to a reputable article
Including a quote from another source
Citing an academic study
Linking to the official documentation
Interviewing knowledgeable professionals
Good:
While [Postgres can handle hundreds of columns](https://nerderati.com/2017/01/03/postgresql-tables-can-have-at-most-1600-columns/), it might not be a good idea to take advantage of this feature.
Bad:
While I’m guessing Postgres can handle a lot of columns, it might not be a good idea to use more than a hundred if you can help it.
 
Plagiarism and Copyright Infringement
Written content that is copied directly from another source must be quoted and cited appropriately. Switching out a few words in a sentence is not enough to make the content original, so be sure to put everything in your own words.
Bad:
I’ve always thought that measuring programming progress by lines of code is akin to measuring aircraft building progress by measuring weight.
Good:
“Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.” - Bill Gates
The bar for using images is even higher. You may not use images from another website unless they expressly allow it. If you need stock images, use a site like Unsplash or one of the options here.
 
The Conclusion
Every article should include a 1-2 paragraph conclusion. This should restate the thesis of the article and remind readers what they learned. It may also include other resources readers can reference to learn more.
Good:
While JSON data types come with some drawbacks, they are useful when you need more flexibility in your data structure. Thanks to Django’s native support for `jsonb`, you can get started using JSON data in your web applications without [learning all the native Postgres query operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html).
Next time you need more flexibility in your data model and want to benefit from the strengths of Postgres give `jsonb` fields a try.
 
Conventions
Write in Markdown
Articles should be written in Markdown and submitted in the Google Doc.
Good:
Markdown is a formatting language often *used by static site generators* and *blogs*. If you aren’t familiar with its syntax, you can [click here to learn more](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Include Unmarked and Annotated Screenshots
If you need to circle something or add some text to a screenshot, please provide a screenshot annotated to the best of your ability, as well as an unmarked copy of the screenshot. This empowers marketing team to redesign them according to our own branding.
If you don’t already have a preference, we suggest using any of the following tools:
dbdiagram.io
Excalidraw
Google Drawings
Mermaid-JS
Lucidchart
These are also all great options for any rough architectural diagrams you may need to make.

Upload Images to Google Drive
If you have screenshots or diagrams in your article, put them to MindsDB shared google drive or other private file/image hosting and embed them using Markdown (MindsDB will upload the images to own hosting when publishing the article). 

Include links and descriptive text that describes the image and easily identify it in the archive. In some cases you can share images in the Zip archive along with the article.

Good:

Bad:

Use Headers to Break Up Sections
Headers make your content more scannable. Use ##, ###, and #### header tags to denote different sections. Headings should be written in title case.
Good:
## How to Use JSON Fields in Your Python Application
…
### The Two JSON Formats Supported by Postgres
…
Bad (not title case):
## How to use JSON fields in your Python application
…
The two JSON formats supported by Postgres
…
Denote Code with Backticks
Use code blocks when the code is one or more lines long or deserves special emphasis.
Good:
```
function snafu() {
return null;
}
```
Bad:
`function snafu() {
return null;
}`
Use inline code when referring to a variable name or short command in context.
Good:
Call the `snafu()` method to exit and return to your command line.
Bad:
Call the “snafu()” method to exit and return to your command line.

Use Double Quotes for Quotations
Use blockquotes when the quote is two or more lines long.
Good:
Some text leading up to the quote.
> “The field/element/path extraction operators return NULL, rather than failing, if the JSON input does not have the right structure to match the request; for example if no such key or array element exists.”
Some text after the quote.
Bad:
Some text leading up to the quote. “The field/element/path extraction operators return NULL, rather than failing, if the JSON input does not have the right structure to match the request; for example if no such key or array element exists.” Some text after the quote.
Use inline quotes when the quote is relatively short or when you’re referencing a single word or phrase.
Good:
“There’s nothing to see here,” said Davies.
Bad:
> “There’s nothing to see here.” - Davies

Use Emphasis Sparingly
Use italics to emphasize text or use bold to suggest strong emphasis.
Good:
There is *nothing* as important as using **spaces** to indent your code.
